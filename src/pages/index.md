Hi, I am Luca Xue. A software developer, currently working at [Suru Partners](https://surupartners.com).

I am still early in my career, and value being able to learn and grow.
My goal is to solve real-world problems and bring value with what I am passionate about.

I am currently working within the PHP and Laravel ecosystem, with VueJS as the frontend framework of choice. However, I have worked with different technologies before, and I have proved to be able to quickly pick up new technologies when necessary.

Outside of programming, I enjoy reading, drawing, and taking long walks.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucaxue), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/luca_xue) and [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/lucaxue).
